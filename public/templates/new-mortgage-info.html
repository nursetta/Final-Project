While the extra income makes a difference to YOU on a monthly basis, it may or may not matter when it comes to qualifying for a loan. A general rule of thumb here is that you need have worked and recieved a consistent amount of overtime income for the last two years. Are you noticing a trend here? Two years generally shows stability to a lender. Dont be discouraged if you dont have full two year history though. Your lender could very well make an exception to count this towards your total income. </div> -->
